# Changelog

## 0.1.1
- Renamed crates to `procedural_tilemaps_core` and `bevy_procedural_tilemaps`, with the Bevy crate re-exporting the core prelude for a single import path.
- Added `prelude` modules for both the core and Bevy crates to make common imports easier.

## 0.1.0
- Initial lean fork prepared for Bevy 0.17 (trimmed debug tooling, internal cartesian grid, tile-layers example).
